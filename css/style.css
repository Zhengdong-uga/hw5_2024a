7. Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.  You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width. 

8. Edit the css for the pricing class to match our example. You should use flex and the cards should be centered both horizontally and vertically.
